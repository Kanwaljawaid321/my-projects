 <p style="color:brown">Spring: Early fresh vegetables include asparagus, radishes, delicate leafy greens like mache and arugula, fiddleheads (a type of edible fern), ramps (a mild, soft onion), mushrooms, strawberries, and peas — first the shoots and flowers, then pea pods, and full-grown peas.
            Summer: The produce bounty includes "stone fruit" (peaches, apricots, and nectarines), cherries, raspberries, blueberries, beets, zucchini, summer squash, string beans, cucumbers, carrots, blackberries, Brussels sprouts, eggplant, corn, okra, melons, tomatoes, peppers, and potatoes.
            Fall: This is the season for apples, pears, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, and mustard greens — heartier produce that won't die if there's a cool night.
            Winter: Now is the time for root vegetables, including turnips, winter squash, celery root, parsnips, sweet potatoes, carrots, and rutabagas.</p>

<p style="color:brown">Protein. Protein is the basis of bones, muscles, and other body structures and is essential to many of the body’s systems.
        Vitamins. These include the antioxidant vitamin E, as well as important B vitamins, notably niacin, thiamin, riboflavin, and B6 — which are involved in many body functions such as regulating the nervous system and making red blood cells.
        Minerals. The main minerals found in meat are iron needed for blood health; zinc, for a healthy immune system; and magnesium, used in the bone-building process.</p>

<p style="color:brown">The scent should be very light and fresh — it shouldn't smell fishy or bad in any way — a sign that the fish has been sitting out too long.
        The flesh should look firm, bright, and clear, and shouldn’t be pulling away from the bones.
        The skin should be shiny with a bright (not faded or dull) color.
        Gills should be clean, clear, and red in color.
        On a whole fish, the eyes should be clear and bulging; sunken, discolored eyes are a sign of fish that isn't fresh.</p>
